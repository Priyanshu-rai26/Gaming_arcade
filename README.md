## Introduction

The goal of this project is to assist in the decision-making process for the expansion of a gaming arcade. By analyzing demographic data, competition presence, and other relevant factors, we aim to provide insights that will guide the expansion strategy.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Collection:** The project involves gathering data from various sources, including demographic data and information on competitors.
  
2. **Data Cleaning:** After collection, the data is cleaned to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure it is ready for analysis.
  
3. **Dashboard Creation:** The cleaned data is used to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Power BI, which visualizes key insights and trends.

## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets:

- **Demographic1.Mall hinterland.xlsx:** Contains demographic information relevant to the gaming arcade's target market.
- **ITCOMPANIES2.xlsx:** Includes data on the presence of IT companies, which can be a factor in the expansion strategy.
- **Competition Online Presence.xlsx:** Details the online presence of competing arcades in the area.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involved:

- Handling missing or incomplete data.
- Normalizing the data formats for consistency.
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant entries.
- Transforming the data to be suitable for analysis.

## Power BI Dashboard

The final output of the project is an interactive dashboard created in Power BI. The dashboard includes:

- **Market Demographics:** Visualization of the target market's demographics.
- **Competitor Analysis:** Insights into the presence and influence of competing arcades.
- **Expansion Recommendations:** Suggestions based on data analysis for potential expansion locations and strategies.
